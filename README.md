# IT-633: Mobile Application Development
This is my final project, which entails creating an Android mobile app using the Google Maps API.
The app will have two main functionalities:
  1. Use the Google Maps API to allow users to find the restaurant and obtain directions to it.
  2. Create an About Us page that features the restaurateurs, chef, manager, and at least 3 other employees. Be sure to include pictures, brief bios, and relevant information.
